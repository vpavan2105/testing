      "content": "Of the nine bowlers who have claimed 500 Test wickets, India's Ravichandran Ashwin - who has joined the club now - is by far the best batter with five centuries.Had Ashwin, 37, chosen to focus on batting to the exclusion of bowling, it is possible he might have finished with over 10,000 Test runs.On Friday, he became only the ninth man to reach the 500-milestone. On the same day, the off-spinner pulled out of the third Test against England because of a family emergency but now he is back with the squad.There is a silken touch to Ashwin's batting and stubbornness that saw him stoutly save a Test alongside Hanuma Vihari. Both batters suffered body blows and injuries in the match.There is a similar combination of the artistic and the abrasive, the classical and the contemporary, in his bowling too. The variations on the off-break theme he developed early meant that at the start of his career he tended to try too many things. (An off-break delivery turns from the off side to the leg side when bowled at a right-handed batsman. It is the most popular method of spin in cricket.)Among Indians, Ashwin's tally is second only to that of Kumble. He told an interviewer some years ago, I am a big fan of Kumble's. He has 619 wickets. If I get to 618 I will be very thankful and that will be my last Test match.It is a peep into the mind of a fascinating man.",

      "content": "Ashley Scoggin, who played basketball at Nebraska from 2020 to 2022, accused former Nebraska associate head coach Chuck Love of using his position and influence to groom her into a sexual relationship, according to a civil lawsuit filed Sunday.The lawsuit lists Love, head coach Amy Williams, athletic director Trev Alberts and the Nebraska school of regents as defendants. Scoggin is seeking unspecified damages for the alleged violation of her civil rights.The University was made aware of the lawsuit this morning,” Nebraska said in a Monday statement. “While the University does not comment on the specifics of pending litigation, it does not agree with the allegations contained in the complaint and intends to vigorously defend this matter.Scoggin, who alleges that Love would summon her for sex in his hotel room when the team traveled for road games, later stated that she felt like she was given less playing time during games after she refused to participate in a group sex session with Love and an undisclosed second man.In February 2022, the lawsuit states team members caught and videotaped Scoggin in Love’s hotel room in State College, Pa., after a practice player tricked a hotel desk clerk into giving him Love’s room key. After showing the video recording to Williams, the lawsuit states that the coach took no measures to protect Scoggin’s confidentiality and “took no measures to meaningfully explore whether what had been reported to her was the result of an abuse of power, ethics and status by Love.",

This initial session of finals features men’s team diving, the 200 medley relay, women’s 3-meter diving, and the 800 freestyle relay.Last year, three different teams won the four relays on the first night of the competition. The Alabama women scored victory in the women’s 200 medley relay, the Tennessee men touched 1st in the men’s medley relay, and Florida swept the 800 free relays. This year, Florida is seeded 1st in 3 out of the 4.The University of Florida women kicked off the 2024 SEC Championships with a win in the 200 medley relay, stopping the clock in 1:34.25. Their time was just 0.07 off the 1:34.18 they posted at the UGA Invite earlier in the season, but tonight’s line-up looked a bit different compared to that meet. Their 1:38.18 swim still ranks them 4th in the NCAA for the 2023-24 season. Today, Aris Runnels (23.90) led them off instead of Bella Sims, while Molly Mayne (26.48), Olivia Peoples (22.33), and Micayla Cronk (21.54) rounded out the victorious quartet. Besides Runnels replacing Sims on the backstroke leg, Cronk featured instead of Isabel Ivey on the freestyle leg today. Presumably, Sims and Ivey will feature on Florida’s 800 free relay later in the night.Both Mayne and Peoples, who returned from the UGA midseason meet, were faster tonight compared to that meet. See a full split comparison between those two relay swims below, in addition to their 2nd place performance from last year:",

Pacer Mukesh Kumar, who was released from the squad for the third Test in Rajkot, has joined the team in Ranchi and is in likely to replace Bumrah, the highest wicket-taker of the series with 17 scalps, in the Playing XI.With KS Bharat keeping wicket for Rohit Sharma’s Team India in Hyderabad, Rahul was added to the Indian XI as a premier batter for the series opener. Rahul scored 86 off 123 balls in the 1st Test against England's Bazeballers at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium. Former India vice-captain Rahul was unavailable for the 2nd Test due to a quadriceps strain.

As Warner recalls, his introduction to life as a travelling T20 gun for hire was even further from glamorous than Aotearoa is from Artarmon with his initial outing in pink for the Knights scheduled for Oamaru, a town of around 14,000 inhabitants in North Otago.That was an eye opener – there wasn't much out there, Warner told reporters at Wellington's Basin Reserve ahead of the first T20 between Australia and New Zealand on Wednesday.",

But how often has it gone the other way round, where a player has performed so well in national colours that it tempted IPL franchises to get into a race to rope in the player? Sarfaraz Khan, who had gone unsold in the auction last December, is most likely to have an IPL contract in hand once again with teams like Kolkata Knight Riders and Chennai Super Kings in a battle to sign the youngster after his stellar debut for India in the third Test against England in Rajkot.After years of consistent performances in the domestic tournaments, Sarfaraz managed to break into the Indian team earlier in January, before earning his maiden international cap last week in Rajkot at the Niranjan Shah Stadium after KL Rahul failed to recover from his quadriceps pain. Despite Ravindra Jadeja earning the Player of the Match award following his all-round brilliance and Yashasvi Jaiswal smashing a second consecutive double ton, Sarfaraz did hog a bit of the limelight with his stunning batting performance as he scored half-centuries in both the innings.",

      "content": "Of the nine bowlers who have claimed 500 Test wickets, India's Ravichandran Ashwin - who has joined the club now - is by far the best batter with five centuries.Had Ashwin, 37, chosen to focus on batting to the exclusion of bowling, it is possible he might have finished with over 10,000 Test runs.On Friday, he became only the ninth man to reach the 500-milestone. On the same day, the off-spinner pulled out of the third Test against England because of a family emergency but now he is back with the squad.There is a silken touch to Ashwin's batting and stubbornness that saw him stoutly save a Test alongside Hanuma Vihari. Both batters suffered body blows and injuries in the match.There is a similar combination of the artistic and the abrasive, the classical and the contemporary, in his bowling too. The variations on the off-break theme he developed early meant that at the start of his career he tended to try too many things. (An off-break delivery turns from the off side to the leg side when bowled at a right-handed batsman. It is the most popular method of spin in cricket.)Among Indians, Ashwin's tally is second only to that of Kumble. He told an interviewer some years ago, I am a big fan of Kumble's. He has 619 wickets. If I get to 618 I will be very thankful and that will be my last Test match.It is a peep into the mind of a fascinating man.",

Some of the shots they are playing require a lot of skills and ability. You can't just come and execute those things, said Dravid at the post match presentation.There's more to it than just attacking cricket. I have seen at times they know when to pull back, when to attack.They have been playing differently, there's no doubt about it.

      "content": "Last week marked the beginning of the end for the longest-running, most high-profile transfer saga of recent years. Kylian Mbappé has told Paris Saint-Germain that he'll leave the club when his contract expires this summer, and that's a significant step in the superstar forward's journey toward joining Real Madrid, the club that has coveted him for so long.If you feel like we've been here before, you're right: Mbappé could have chosen Madrid before he signed for PSG in 2017. He could have arrived in Madrid in the summer of 2021, when PSG rebuffed a string of offers, or in 2022 when everybody -- including Mbappé and Madrid -- was convinced that he would sign on a free transfer before he bowed to PSG pressure and renewed his contract.Last June, Mbappé's revelation that he would not be extending his contract any further -- meaning he would be available in 2024 as a free agent -- left Madrid hopeful of a deal, but again, Mbappé stayed in Paris. That meant more months of speculation before ESPN reported on Feb. 3 that the player was finally ready to confirm his long-anticipated departure, with Madrid the likely destination.Madrid and Mbappé are in talks, with the club optimistic of reaching an agreement soon. In the meantime, ESPN examines the player's decision-making process over recent months to assess where that decision leaves Mbappé, Real Madrid and PSG.",

I know she’ll come back strong and hopefully be in the mix for the next World Cup. ",

      "content": "Last week marked the beginning of the end for the longest-running, most high-profile transfer saga of recent years. Kylian Mbappé has told Paris Saint-Germain that he'll leave the club when his contract expires this summer, and that's a significant step in the superstar forward's journey toward joining Real Madrid, the club that has coveted him for so longMbappé, who was born in Paris, has spent seven seasons at PSG. In Ligue 1, France's top league, he won everything on multiple occasions. He also tried to bring the Champions League crown to Paris for the first time ever, coming closest in 2020 when they lost to Bayern Munich in the final. He broke pretty much every individual club record possible -- including surpassing Pedro Miguel Pauleta, Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Edison Cavani as the top scorer in the club's history with 244 goals (as of Feb. 20) -- and at 25, he will join Real Madrid, the biggest club in the world who have been trying to sign him since he was 11 years old, as a free agent.From as young as he can remember, he wanted to wear the famous white shirt and play at the Bernabeu, and Mbappé felt this was the perfect time. We've been here before, of course -- it wasn't perfect two years ago when, out of contract with PSG, he had an agreement with los Blancos. It wasn't perfect three years ago when the Spanish giants made PSG an offer of €160 million -- Mbappé had just a year left on his contract at the time -- but the Parisians rejected it.",

An expected vote last month was delayed at the Pac-12’s request.The original plan for the 12-team format was to have the six highest-ranked conference champions, with the top four receiving first-round byes, and six at-large selections. But with one fewer so-called power conference after the Pac-12’s demise, the commissioners who manage the CFP recommended the change from the 6-6 format to 5-7.No conference will have automatic access. Those five slots will go to the highest-ranked conference champs as determined by the CFP selection committee, ensuring at least one team from outside the Atlantic Coast Conference, Big Ten, Big 12 and Southeastern Conference will make the 12-team field.",

      "content": "Manchester City overcame Brentford 1-0 to move within a point of Liverpool at the top of the Premier League.City struggled to break Brentford down during the first half, with only one chance threatening the visiting goal. Oscar Bobb broke into the box and dribbled past Brentford defenders. His shot was low and beat opposition goalkeeper Mark Flekken, only for the ball to be cleared off the line by Ben Mee.The hosts still struggled to make solid chances in the second half of the game. That all changed, though, when Erling Haaland was played through on goal in the 71st minute. Haaland slotted the ball low past Flekken to put City into the lead.Here, Sam Lee analyses an important win for City in the race for the title.One thing that stood out about this game was the similarity in atmosphere inside the Etihad Stadium and the performance on the pitch. For much of the game, everything the City players did was rushed, imprecise and impatient, and the frustration in the crowd — and the fans’ impatience — was not just palpable but overwhelming.Haaland’s goal came at a very opportune moment for everybody of a blue persuasion because it is hard to imagine City’s performance or the fans’ mood even staying at the same level, let alone improving, had the big Norwegian not done the business.It seemed that nothing gelled properly and nothing was done at the right speed.",

When the fans are frustrated and impatient, it adds pressure to the players, making them rush and play imprecisely. Haaland's goal was crucial not just for the scoreline but also for boosting the morale of both the team and the fans."

          "comment": "While I understand the connection between the atmosphere in the stadium and the players' performance, I think it's unfair to solely attribute City's struggles to the crowd's mood. Football is a game of many variables, and sometimes teams just have off days or struggle to find their rhythm. Haaland's goal undoubtedly lifted spirits, but it's oversimplifying to suggest that the entire performance hinged solely on the fans' mood."

At this point you have to hope that Syracuse has five players with solid to strong games for the Orange to win. Is it enough to slow down DJ Horne and DJ Burns?

      "content": "As Spring Training continues to get underway, here are three things we’ll be keeping an eye on around the baseball world throughout the day today:Amidst the ongoing MLB offseason, notable developments are reshaping the market landscape. With Hyun Jin Ryu's departure to the Korea Baseball Organization, attention shifts to the remaining second-tier starting pitchers like Michael Lorenzen and Mike Clevinger. While veteran options such as Zack Greinke and Johnny Cueto are available, teams like the Angels, Twins, and Padres are seeking rotation additions, potentially leading to increased demand for these pitchers. Conversely, uncertainty looms over Cody Bellinger's contract talks with the Cubs. Despite his impressive performance in 2023, with a .307/.356/.525 slash line, negotiations seem stagnant, prompting speculation of a late push from other teams for the outfielder. As teams gear up for spring training, significant free agents remain unsigned, leaving fans eager for potential roster additions and unresolved offseason shopping lists. To delve deeper into these ongoing discussions and offseason dynamics, MLBTR is hosting a live chat with readers, providing insights and addressing queries, as teams prepare for the upcoming season in Arizona and Florida.",

Red Bull has seemingly split its inlet into two parts on the 2024 car.While the RB20 appeared to be a handful early on in the four-hour session, it looked far more cooperative when Verstappen switched to the mid-range, yellow-sidewalled C3 tyre and he went fastest inside the first two hours.Verstappen, who is back in the Red Bull later on Wednesday afternoon, went faster still on a subsequent run and ended the session with a best time of 1m32.548s - meaning he was the only driver to eclipse his 2023 day one benchmark (1m32.837s).Charles Leclerc had been within two tenths of the Red Bull at one stage but Verstappen's improvement meant the Ferrari driver ended the session 0.699 seconds adrift.Leclerc had a couple of lock-ups and the SF-24 appeared to suffer from some bouncing on the approach to Turn 1 but his session was otherwise trouble-free.",

      "content": "The Chicago Bears haven't necessarily begun soliciting offers for quarterback Justin Fields, but other NFL teams began inquiring about a potential trade for the former first-round draft pick at this year's Senior Bowl, according to Sports Illustrated.Pre-draft events, including the scouting combine, have often served as an unofficial catalyst for trade talks, and those conversations with other NFL teams allowed Chicago staffers to start to gauge Fields' value this offseason, per Albert Breer.The Bears still really like Fields as a QB prospect three years after drafting him No. 11 overall, according to Breer, but they are meeting over the next couple weeks to finalize plans at the position. Many expect the team to use this year's No. 1 overall selection on a consensus top QB prospect like USC's Caleb Williams, effectively resetting the position (and its contract situation).If the Bears intend to replace Fields at the top of the draft, it stands to reason they'll look to trade their current starter sooner rather than later, in order to capitalize on the pre-draft QB market. While trades cannot be finalized until March 13, the official start of the 2024 league year, terms of an agreement can be negotiated and preliminarily accepted at any point between now and then.Fields has drawn strong reviews from Bears teammates after three promising but injury- and turnover-riddled seasons in Chicago. But Williams, North Carolina's Drake Maye and LSU's Jayden Daniels are all expected to come off the board early in the draft at QB.",

He said, “Ours is a movie about the Indian Air Force. I haven’t seen Fighter. I am sure we are bringing a unique perspective to the audience. Whatever we are showing in our film happens very commonly in the Air Force. But not many people know about it. Operation Valentine is not just about action. It explores the camaraderie and relationship among Air Force pilots.”The movie is produced by Sony Pictures International Productions, Sandeep Mudda’s Renaissance Pictures, and co-produced by God Bless Entertainment (Vakil Khan) and Nandakumar Abbineni.

Ryan Reynolds stars and, this time, he’s bringing along his friend Hugh Jackman as Wolverine.Directed by Shawn Levy, Deadpool 3 is one of the most highly anticipated Marvel films in years and now the first trailer is here. As he celebrates his birthday with his found (and Fox) family, Deadpool’s kidnapped by the TVA and personally invited to join the MCU. But things seemingly don’t go according to plan, and he ends up having to kill a lot of people (as he often does), with Jackman’s Wolverine by his side.Filming only wrapped a few weeks ago, so the fact that we’re getting a trailer at all for this is pretty incredible. So, what do you think?",

But it won’t exactly be another Evil Dead sequel.According to Deadline, which broke the news, Vaniček will co-write and direct “a new spin-off of the Evil Dead franchise for Sam Raimi and Robert Tapert’s Ghost House Pictures,” with plot details still “under wraps.” This is an intriguing way to frame the new entry, which has already seen a trio of original films (1981's The Evil Dead, 1987's Evil Dead Rise, and 1992's Army of Darkness, all directed by Raimi and starring Bruce Campbell); the 2013 reboot from Fede Álvarez, who has a new Alien movie coming this year; and the Starz TV series Ash vs. Evil Dead, which also starred Campbell and ran from 2015-2018. And, of course, there was 2023's Evil Dead Rise, which earned critical praise and went on to become the highest-grossing film in the series to date—and is more of a standalone, spinning out the mythology of Raimi’s creation with new characters and a new setting.",

      "content": "NEW YORK -- In the mid-1970s, the Eagles were working on a spooky, cryptic new song.On a lined yellow pad, Don Henley, with input from band co-founder Glenn Frey, jotted thoughts about “a dark desert highway and “a lovely place” with a luxurious surface and ominous undertones. And something on ice, perhaps caviar or Taittinger — or pink Champagne?The song, “Hotel California,” became one of rock's most indelible singles. And nearly a half-century later, those handwritten pages of lyrics-in-the-making have become the center of an unusual criminal trial set to open Wednesday.Rare-book dealer Glenn Horowitz, former Rock & Roll Hall of Fame curator Craig Inciardi and memorabilia seller Edward Kosinski are charged with conspiring to own and try to sell manuscripts of “Hotel California” and other Eagles hits without the right to do so.The three have pleaded not guilty, and their lawyers have said the men committed no crime with the papers, which they acquired via a writer who'd worked with the Eagles. But the Manhattan district attorney’s office says the defendants connived to obscure the documents’ disputed ownership, despite knowing that Henley said the pages were stolen.Clashes over valuable collectibles abound, but criminal trials like this are rare. Many fights are resolved in private, in lawsuits or with agreements to return the items.“If you can avoid a prosecution by handing over the thing, most people just hand it over, said Travis McDade, a University of Illinois law professor who studies rare document disputes.",

But as I reflect in hindsight about a Tweet made in jest, I also release (realise) the distasteful nature of it. The same could have been said without adding the cartoon which was published in a newspaper,” he said.“I’d with utmost humility like to apologise to each and everyone who has been hurt As you all by now know, that I hold all faiths, beliefs and religions with the highest possible regard.

Two of the capsule's 35 fasteners got stuck, forcing  NASA researchers to initially only collect about 2.48 ounces (70.3 grams) of sample resting on the lid of the canister.Then, after specially designing and testing bespoke tools for the task, scientists finally opened the lid's last two clasps.

For millions of people along the path of totality, where the Moon will completely cover the Sun, it may feel like an eerie daytime darkness has descended as temperatures drop and wind patterns change. But these changes are mild compared to what happens some 100 to 400 miles above our heads in an electrically conductive layer of our atmosphere known as the ionosphere, where the “false night” of an eclipse is amplified a hundredfold. Three NASA-funded experiments will investigate the eclipse’s effects on the ionosphere through the power of radio, a technology well suited to studying this enigmatic layer of our atmosphere. Whether you’ve heard of the ionosphere or not, you’ve likely taken advantage of its existence. This electric blanket of particles is critical for long-distance AM and shortwave radio. Radio operators aim their transmitters into the sky, “bouncing” signals off this layer and around the curvature of Earth to extend their broadcast by hundreds or even thousands of miles.",

This will ensure that the mission leaves no debris, Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) said.The agency on Saturday also announced that its meteorological satellite INSAT-3DS has been sent off to Sriharikota from U R Rao Satellite Centre, Bengaluru, where it was developed. The mission is likely to be launched mid-February onboard GSLV.To cut down on space debris, ISRO has been taking steps such as lowering the orbit of defunct satellites and last stages of the rockets, and removing excess fuel since last year.In fact, the orbit of POEM-3 (PSLV Orbital Experimental Module-3) was lowered from 650 km to 350 km after the space observatory XPoSat was placed in orbit to reduce the time the platform remains in orbit.The space agency said that the platform had completed 400 orbits by the 25th day. During this period, each of the nine experiments were put to operation and their performance determined. The experiments include the Women Engineered Satellite (WESAT) developed by LBS Institute of Technology for Women to study the comparison between solar irradiance and UV index, a radiation shielding experiment, an amateur radio, three propulsion systems by space start-ups, and an interplanetary dust count experiment by Physical Research Laboratory.

The craft's payload capabilities don't vastly exceed the workhorse H-IIA that Japan has successfully launched almost 50 times, but it is cheaper to operate. Japan's space exploration agency (JAXA) hopes the H3 will therefore allow it to launch more of its own payloads and win business. The launcher will also help JAXA's contributions to the International Space Station.Sadly, March 2023's debut H3 launch did not go well. At the time, JAXA thought the command to ignite its second stage was not received. After observing telemetry suggesting the rocket had worryingly slowed its ascent, JAXA sent an instruction to self-destruct. That message was received and executed, sending the H3 and the land observation satellite it carried to their doom.",

This significant finding, enhancing understanding of climate interactions, calls for more research in boreal forests to inform climate modeling and policy decisions. Credit: SciTechDaily.comRecent research has discovered that, in contrast to earlier assumptions, substantial quantities of aerosol particles are generated across extensive regions of the West Siberian taiga during spring. These findings indicate that rising temperatures can greatly influence the climate due to this phenomenon.Aerosol particles significantly contribute to the Earth’s cooling process. They can impact the amount of sunlight that reaches the Earth’s surface either directly or indirectly by aiding in cloud formation. These particles originate from various gas molecules and are found all over the planet.To understand the circumstances in which these particles are formed, researchers conduct measurements in various environments all over the world. For example, the Finnish flagship station SMEAR II has conducted measurements in the boreal forest for 25 years.However, the boreal forest is an extremely large area, and much of its contribution to aerosol formation has still not been explored, especially in its Siberian and Canadian parts.Previous studies have suggested that particle formation is rare in Siberia. However, a recent study by the University of Helsinki showed that particle formation in Siberia was frequent and was connected to heat conditions. The results of the study were published in the journal Environmental Research Letters.",

This means they were somehow born without dark matter seeding their formation, contrary to what the standard model of galaxy formation suggests.How this could have happened is unclear, but much like previous JWST discoveries of other inexplicably massive galaxies in the early universe, it threatens to upend our understanding of how the first matter in the universe formed, or possibly even the standard model of cosmology itself. The researchers published their findings Feb. 14 in the journal Nature.Light travels at a fixed speed through the vacuum of space, so the deeper we look into the universe, the more remote light we intercept and the further back in time we see. This is what enabled the researchers to use JWST to spot ZF-UDS-7329 roughly 11.5 billion years in the past.By studying the spectra of light coming from the stars of this extremely distant galaxy, the researchers found that the stars were born 1.5 billion years prior to that observation, or roughly 13 billion years ago.",

J0526B is a hot subdwarf star and we are not exaggerating when we say it is tiny. It has a radius just seven times that of Earth. To compare, Jupiter’s radius is 11.2 times Earth’s own, Saturn's is 9.5, and Neptune's is four times Earth's. This is the smallest star ever discovered by volume, and yet it is still a star. Packed into that small volume is about one-third of the mass of the Sun so this tiny star weighs about 350 times that of Jupiter. The heavier object, J0526A, is a white dwarf that weighs about 74 percent of the Sun. It is rich in carbon and oxygen, indicating what kind of star it evolved from. White dwarfs are the destiny of stars like the Sun. Not massive enough to go supernova, the small stars evolve into red giants before shedding their outer layers, exposing an extremely dense degenerate core in a volume not much bigger than our planet.

That left the upper stage and its payload, a Lockheed Martin technology demonstration satellite, in an orbit with a low perigee.The investigation, which included the company’s own mishap team as well as an independent review, found that the error in the GNC software algorithm “prevented the system from sending the necessary pulse commands to the Reaction Control System (RCS) thrusters ahead of the stage two engine relight.” Firefly didn’t elaborate on the issue, but the RCS thrusters likely would have been used to ensure the stage was in the proper orientation and to settle its tanks so propellant would flow from them into the engine.",
