            "content": "Of the nine bowlers who have claimed 500 Test wickets, India's Ravichandran Ashwin - who has joined the club now - is by far the best batter with five centuries.Had Ashwin, 37, chosen to focus on batting to the exclusion of bowling, it is possible he might have finished with over 10,000 Test runs.On Friday, he became only the ninth man to reach the 500-milestone. On the same day, the off-spinner pulled out of the third Test against England because of a family emergency but now he is back with the squad.There is a silken touch to Ashwin's batting and stubbornness that saw him stoutly save a Test alongside Hanuma Vihari. Both batters suffered body blows and injuries in the match.There is a similar combination of the artistic and the abrasive, the classical and the contemporary, in his bowling too. The variations on the off-break theme he developed early meant that at the start of his career he tended to try too many things. (An off-break delivery turns from the off side to the leg side when bowled at a right-handed batsman. It is the most popular method of spin in cricket.)Among Indians, Ashwin's tally is second only to that of Kumble. He told an interviewer some years ago, I am a big fan of Kumble's. He has 619 wickets. If I get to 618 I will be very thankful and that will be my last Test match.It is a peep into the mind of a fascinating man.",

Scoggin is seeking unspecified damages for the alleged violation of her civil rights.The University was made aware of the lawsuit this morning,” Nebraska said in a Monday statement. “While the University does not comment on the specifics of pending litigation, it does not agree with the allegations contained in the complaint and intends to vigorously defend this matter.Scoggin, who alleges that Love would summon her for sex in his hotel room when the team traveled for road games, later stated that she felt like she was given less playing time during games after she refused to participate in a group sex session with Love and an undisclosed second man.In February 2022, the lawsuit states team members caught and videotaped Scoggin in Love’s hotel room in State College, Pa., after a practice player tricked a hotel desk clerk into giving him Love’s room key. After showing the video recording to Williams, the lawsuit states that the coach took no measures to protect Scoggin’s confidentiality and “took no measures to meaningfully explore whether what had been reported to her was the result of an abuse of power, ethics and status by Love.",

This initial session of finals features men’s team diving, the 200 medley relay, women’s 3-meter diving, and the 800 freestyle relay.Last year, three different teams won the four relays on the first night of the competition. The Alabama women scored victory in the women’s 200 medley relay, the Tennessee men touched 1st in the men’s medley relay, and Florida swept the 800 free relays. This year, Florida is seeded 1st in 3 out of the 4.The University of Florida women kicked off the 2024 SEC Championships with a win in the 200 medley relay, stopping the clock in 1:34.25. Their time was just 0.07 off the 1:34.18 they posted at the UGA Invite earlier in the season, but tonight’s line-up looked a bit different compared to that meet. Their 1:38.18 swim still ranks them 4th in the NCAA for the 2023-24 season. Today, Aris Runnels (23.90) led them off instead of Bella Sims, while Molly Mayne (26.48), Olivia Peoples (22.33), and Micayla Cronk (21.54) rounded out the victorious quartet. Besides Runnels replacing Sims on the backstroke leg, Cronk featured instead of Isabel Ivey on the freestyle leg today. Presumably, Sims and Ivey will feature on Florida’s 800 free relay later in the night.Both Mayne and Peoples, who returned from the UGA midseason meet, were faster tonight compared to that meet. See a full split comparison between those two relay swims below, in addition to their 2nd place performance from last year:",

Pacer Mukesh Kumar, who was released from the squad for the third Test in Rajkot, has joined the team in Ranchi and is in likely to replace Bumrah, the highest wicket-taker of the series with 17 scalps, in the Playing XI.With KS Bharat keeping wicket for Rohit Sharma’s Team India in Hyderabad, Rahul was added to the Indian XI as a premier batter for the series opener. Rahul scored 86 off 123 balls in the 1st Test against England's Bazeballers at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium. Former India vice-captain Rahul was unavailable for the 2nd Test due to a quadriceps strain. Rahul was then ruled out of the 3rd Test against England after reaching only 90 per cent of match fitness.",

He is followed by Fakhar Zaman on the list of highest run-getters in the tournament’s history.The former Pakistan captain got a fantastic start to the tournament, amassing a glorious fifty against Quetta Gladiators. In the ongoing match, he is fighting for his side despite losing his partners at the other end. After being invited to bat, the Zalmi lost the valuable wicket of Saim Ayub, who was cleaned up by veteran all-rounder Shoaib Malik. The cheap dismissals of Mohammad Haris and Tom Kohler-Cadmore have pushed them down on the mat, as they are reeling at 58 for three in 7.3 overs as of writing.",

As Warner recalls, his introduction to life as a travelling T20 gun for hire was even further from glamorous than Aotearoa is from Artarmon with his initial outing in pink for the Knights scheduled for Oamaru, a town of around 14,000 inhabitants in North Otago.That was an eye opener – there wasn't much out there, Warner told reporters at Wellington's Basin Reserve ahead of the first T20 between Australia and New Zealand on Wednesday.",

But how often has it gone the other way round, where a player has performed so well in national colours that it tempted IPL franchises to get into a race to rope in the player? Sarfaraz Khan, who had gone unsold in the auction last December, is most likely to have an IPL contract in hand once again with teams like Kolkata Knight Riders and Chennai Super Kings in a battle to sign the youngster after his stellar debut for India in the third Test against England in Rajkot.After years of consistent performances in the domestic tournaments, Sarfaraz managed to break into the Indian team earlier in January, before earning his maiden international cap last week in Rajkot at the Niranjan Shah Stadium after KL Rahul failed to recover from his quadriceps pain. Despite Ravindra Jadeja earning the Player of the Match award following his all-round brilliance and Yashasvi Jaiswal smashing a second consecutive double ton, Sarfaraz did hog a bit of the limelight with his stunning batting performance as he scored half-centuries in both the innings.",

On the same day, the off-spinner pulled out of the third Test against England because of a family emergency but now he is back with the squad.There is a silken touch to Ashwin's batting and stubbornness that saw him stoutly save a Test alongside Hanuma Vihari. Both batters suffered body blows and injuries in the match.There is a similar combination of the artistic and the abrasive, the classical and the contemporary, in his bowling too. The variations on the off-break theme he developed early meant that at the start of his career he tended to try too many things. (An off-break delivery turns from the off side to the leg side when bowled at a right-handed batsman. It is the most popular method of spin in cricket.)Among Indians, Ashwin's tally is second only to that of Kumble. He told an interviewer some years ago, I am a big fan of Kumble's. He has 619 wickets. If I get to 618 I will be very thankful and that will be my last Test match.It is a peep into the mind of a fascinating man.",

You can't just come and execute those things, said Dravid at the post match presentation.There's more to it than just attacking cricket. I have seen at times they know when to pull back, when to attack.They have been playing differently, there's no doubt about it.

Kylian Mbappé has told Paris Saint-Germain that he'll leave the club when his contract expires this summer, and that's a significant step in the superstar forward's journey toward joining Real Madrid, the club that has coveted him for so long.If you feel like we've been here before, you're right: Mbappé could have chosen Madrid before he signed for PSG in 2017. He could have arrived in Madrid in the summer of 2021, when PSG rebuffed a string of offers, or in 2022 when everybody -- including Mbappé and Madrid -- was convinced that he would sign on a free transfer before he bowed to PSG pressure and renewed his contract.Last June, Mbappé's revelation that he would not be extending his contract any further -- meaning he would be available in 2024 as a free agent -- left Madrid hopeful of a deal, but again, Mbappé stayed in Paris. That meant more months of speculation before ESPN reported on Feb. 3 that the player was finally ready to confirm his long-anticipated departure, with Madrid the likely destination.Madrid and Mbappé are in talks, with the club optimistic of reaching an agreement soon. In the meantime, ESPN examines the player's decision-making process over recent months to assess where that decision leaves Mbappé, Real Madrid and PSG.",

The Argentina football great's non-appearance on February 4 match in Hong Kong led to widespread anger among the fans present at the stadium, and this spread out to the special administrative region's politicians and to the larger Chinese state media when Messi came off the bench in a friendly just three days later in Tokyo, Japan.The fallout has rumbled along with the cities of Hangzhou and Beijing they will not host Argentina games scheduled for March. Messi has now finally addressed those angered by his absence in Hong Kong in a video posted on one of China's largest social media platforms. I've read and heard many things that have been said after the game in Hong Kong. I wanted to record this video and give you the true version so nobody has to continue reading false stories, Messi said in a video posted on Weibo.",

Kylian Mbappé has told Paris Saint-Germain that he'll leave the club when his contract expires this summer, and that's a significant step in the superstar forward's journey toward joining Real Madrid, the club that has coveted him for so longMbappé, who was born in Paris, has spent seven seasons at PSG. In Ligue 1, France's top league, he won everything on multiple occasions. He also tried to bring the Champions League crown to Paris for the first time ever, coming closest in 2020 when they lost to Bayern Munich in the final. He broke pretty much every individual club record possible -- including surpassing Pedro Miguel Pauleta, Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Edison Cavani as the top scorer in the club's history with 244 goals (as of Feb. 20) -- and at 25, he will join Real Madrid, the biggest club in the world who have been trying to sign him since he was 11 years old, as a free agent.From as young as he can remember, he wanted to wear the famous white shirt and play at the Bernabeu, and Mbappé felt this was the perfect time. We've been here before, of course -- it wasn't perfect two years ago when, out of contract with PSG, he had an agreement with los Blancos. It wasn't perfect three years ago when the Spanish giants made PSG an offer of €160 million -- Mbappé had just a year left on his contract at the time -- but the Parisians rejected it.",

An expected vote last month was delayed at the Pac-12’s request.The original plan for the 12-team format was to have the six highest-ranked conference champions, with the top four receiving first-round byes, and six at-large selections. But with one fewer so-called power conference after the Pac-12’s demise, the commissioners who manage the CFP recommended the change from the 6-6 format to 5-7.No conference will have automatic access. Those five slots will go to the highest-ranked conference champs as determined by the CFP selection committee, ensuring at least one team from outside the Atlantic Coast Conference, Big Ten, Big 12 and Southeastern Conference will make the 12-team field.",

            "content": "Manchester City overcame Brentford 1-0 to move within a point of Liverpool at the top of the Premier League.City struggled to break Brentford down during the first half, with only one chance threatening the visiting goal. Oscar Bobb broke into the box and dribbled past Brentford defenders. His shot was low and beat opposition goalkeeper Mark Flekken, only for the ball to be cleared off the line by Ben Mee.The hosts still struggled to make solid chances in the second half of the game. That all changed, though, when Erling Haaland was played through on goal in the 71st minute. Haaland slotted the ball low past Flekken to put City into the lead.Here, Sam Lee analyses an important win for City in the race for the title.One thing that stood out about this game was the similarity in atmosphere inside the Etihad Stadium and the performance on the pitch. For much of the game, everything the City players did was rushed, imprecise and impatient, and the frustration in the crowd — and the fans’ impatience — was not just palpable but overwhelming.Haaland’s goal came at a very opportune moment for everybody of a blue persuasion because it is hard to imagine City’s performance or the fans’ mood even staying at the same level, let alone improving, had the big Norwegian not done the business.It seemed that nothing gelled properly and nothing was done at the right speed.",

Haaland's goal undoubtedly lifted spirits, but it's oversimplifying to suggest that the entire performance hinged solely on the fans' mood."

According to Yahoo!’s Dan Wetzel, fewer than 2,000 tickets across the seven sessions remain, which would make the first full sell-out of the event.The impact of her success does not stop on the court. She became the Fanatics’ top-selling college athlete in the NIL Era last week after she surpassed Kelsey Plum’s scoring title. She passed the previous high seller, Colorado quarterback Shedeur Sanders.One of the top sellers was Nike apparel with the phrase, “You break it, you own it.” The sneaker and sportswear giant released a graphic with the slogan after Clark broke the NCAA women’s scoring record and then released special merchandise with it.

With Hyun Jin Ryu's departure to the Korea Baseball Organization, attention shifts to the remaining second-tier starting pitchers like Michael Lorenzen and Mike Clevinger. While veteran options such as Zack Greinke and Johnny Cueto are available, teams like the Angels, Twins, and Padres are seeking rotation additions, potentially leading to increased demand for these pitchers. Conversely, uncertainty looms over Cody Bellinger's contract talks with the Cubs. Despite his impressive performance in 2023, with a .307/.356/.525 slash line, negotiations seem stagnant, prompting speculation of a late push from other teams for the outfielder. As teams gear up for spring training, significant free agents remain unsigned, leaving fans eager for potential roster additions and unresolved offseason shopping lists. To delve deeper into these ongoing discussions and offseason dynamics, MLBTR is hosting a live chat with readers, providing insights and addressing queries, as teams prepare for the upcoming season in Arizona and Florida.",

Red Bull has seemingly split its inlet into two parts on the 2024 car.While the RB20 appeared to be a handful early on in the four-hour session, it looked far more cooperative when Verstappen switched to the mid-range, yellow-sidewalled C3 tyre and he went fastest inside the first two hours.Verstappen, who is back in the Red Bull later on Wednesday afternoon, went faster still on a subsequent run and ended the session with a best time of 1m32.548s - meaning he was the only driver to eclipse his 2023 day one benchmark (1m32.837s).Charles Leclerc had been within two tenths of the Red Bull at one stage but Verstappen's improvement meant the Ferrari driver ended the session 0.699 seconds adrift.Leclerc had a couple of lock-ups and the SF-24 appeared to suffer from some bouncing on the approach to Turn 1 but his session was otherwise trouble-free.",

Many expect the team to use this year's No. 1 overall selection on a consensus top QB prospect like USC's Caleb Williams, effectively resetting the position (and its contract situation).If the Bears intend to replace Fields at the top of the draft, it stands to reason they'll look to trade their current starter sooner rather than later, in order to capitalize on the pre-draft QB market. While trades cannot be finalized until March 13, the official start of the 2024 league year, terms of an agreement can be negotiated and preliminarily accepted at any point between now and then.Fields has drawn strong reviews from Bears teammates after three promising but injury- and turnover-riddled seasons in Chicago. But Williams, North Carolina's Drake Maye and LSU's Jayden Daniels are all expected to come off the board early in the draft at QB.",

It can be a special year for us.Neil Gourley is the reigning British 1500m champion and will be in competition with his fellow Scots for places in Paris.Kerr is third in the current world rankings, with Gourley eighth as Wightman makes his way back from injury.Having stunned Olympic champion Jakob Ingebrigtsen in Budapest in August, Kerr will no longer be under the radar.Of course it comes with external pressure but I love that,he told BBC Scotland's The Nine.",

I would've been happy with just getting on the podium. This morning in heats, the U.S., Great Britain and Italy were all quicker than us, and I just wanted to focus on doing my job well.I told myself, Just swim hard. I was shocked when I saw the time. I wasn't expecting to break the record now -- I wanted to leave it for the Paris 2024 Olympic Games.China won the relay in 3:11.08. Italy finished a second behind, with the United States rounding off the podium in 3:12.29.Erika Fairweather became New Zealand's first gold medalist at a World Aquatics Championships by winning the women's 400 freestyle.

I extend my heartfelt thanks to the audience.The Superhero flick ‘HanuMan’ takes place in a made-up town named Anjanadari and follows a young guy as he acquires the strength of Lord Hanuman.

The song is also No. 2 on the Hot 100 behind Jack Harlow’s “Lovin on Me.”Beyoncé announced her next album on Feb. 11 after teasing new music during a Super Bowl commercial for Verizon. Shortly after the ad premiered, “Texas Hold ‘Em” and “16 Carriages” hit streaming services to immediate success. The former song had 19.2 million official streams, while the latter had 10.3 million streams, which placed it at No. 9 on the country chart.Following fan outcry, Columbia Nashville announced that it would officially promote “Texas Hold ‘Em” to country radio stations on Feb. 14. Though it wasn’t immediately clear whether either song would officially hit country radio, station managers told EW that they were playing “Texas Hold ‘Em” anyway, and that the response had been overwhelmingly positive. “I added the song because it's a great song, and I'm excited because it just sounds so freaking good on the radio,” 93Q Country’s Travis Moon told EW. “And if there are some of her fans who listen to the song on my radio station that like some other songs, that's actually good for my station.” ",

Ryan Reynolds stars and, this time, he’s bringing along his friend Hugh Jackman as Wolverine.Directed by Shawn Levy, Deadpool 3 is one of the most highly anticipated Marvel films in years and now the first trailer is here. As he celebrates his birthday with his found (and Fox) family, Deadpool’s kidnapped by the TVA and personally invited to join the MCU. But things seemingly don’t go according to plan, and he ends up having to kill a lot of people (as he often does), with Jackman’s Wolverine by his side.Filming only wrapped a few weeks ago, so the fact that we’re getting a trailer at all for this is pretty incredible.

But it won’t exactly be another Evil Dead sequel.According to Deadline, which broke the news, Vaniček will co-write and direct “a new spin-off of the Evil Dead franchise for Sam Raimi and Robert Tapert’s Ghost House Pictures,” with plot details still “under wraps.” This is an intriguing way to frame the new entry, which has already seen a trio of original films (1981's The Evil Dead, 1987's Evil Dead Rise, and 1992's Army of Darkness, all directed by Raimi and starring Bruce Campbell); the 2013 reboot from Fede Álvarez, who has a new Alien movie coming this year; and the Starz TV series Ash vs. Evil Dead, which also starred Campbell and ran from 2015-2018. And, of course, there was 2023's Evil Dead Rise, which earned critical praise and went on to become the highest-grossing film in the series to date—and is more of a standalone, spinning out the mythology of Raimi’s creation with new characters and a new setting.",

Keep reading to know more!Directed by Siddharth Anand, the magnum opus was released in theatres on 25th January.

I definitely will not mention names because we are not just good friends but also mutual co artistes in the film fraternity.

And something on ice, perhaps caviar or Taittinger — or pink Champagne?The song, “Hotel California,” became one of rock's most indelible singles. And nearly a half-century later, those handwritten pages of lyrics-in-the-making have become the center of an unusual criminal trial set to open Wednesday.Rare-book dealer Glenn Horowitz, former Rock & Roll Hall of Fame curator Craig Inciardi and memorabilia seller Edward Kosinski are charged with conspiring to own and try to sell manuscripts of “Hotel California” and other Eagles hits without the right to do so.The three have pleaded not guilty, and their lawyers have said the men committed no crime with the papers, which they acquired via a writer who'd worked with the Eagles. But the Manhattan district attorney’s office says the defendants connived to obscure the documents’ disputed ownership, despite knowing that Henley said the pages were stolen.Clashes over valuable collectibles abound, but criminal trials like this are rare. Many fights are resolved in private, in lawsuits or with agreements to return the items.“If you can avoid a prosecution by handing over the thing, most people just hand it over, said Travis McDade, a University of Illinois law professor who studies rare document disputes.",

The same could have been said without adding the cartoon which was published in a newspaper,” he said.“I’d with utmost humility like to apologise to each and everyone who has been hurt As you all by now know, that I hold all faiths, beliefs and religions with the highest possible regard.

            "description": "Around 200 members of the Sikh community staged a demonstration in Kolkata to show support for an IPS officer who alleged that a West Bengal BJP leader called him a 'Khalistani'. The BJP leaders denied the allegations, stating that no one had used that term. The IPS officer questioned the use of the term, stating that it was unfair to label someone a 'Khalistani' based on their religious attire. The Sikh community demanded an apology from the BJP, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and Union Home Minister Amit Shah.",
